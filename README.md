Additional valet keys are $5 + tax so around $8.50

**Amie’s rambling side notes: what I find interesting is that there is no external identifier on the back or front of the valet key cards. So if you were to park in valet with 50 other Tesla Model 3, how would tell be able to tell the difference in your key card and someone else’s. Similar to hotel room keys where they just match it to the hotel room.

I’ve ordered 2 more keys and I’m going to have a Tesla service technician come out and show me how he pairs the keys to my car.





Made appointment(Monday November 26th) with Tesla to have the service technician come to my house to connect a few valet cards to see the process. I know at the Tesla service center they take your car in the back and connect the valet keycards in the back shop area. My hopes are that they having the service come to my house that I will be able to see the process of connecting the valet key to the car.

### Level 5. Tesla Valet Key

### Level 6. Bug Crowd
I'm part of Telsa bug crowd bounty, and I've been looking through, to see what information I can get from the car, to see if writing data to my current rfid hand implant is a possibility.

Sacrificing for the cause: Melting my Tesla Valet cards with acetone to get the chip
Melting the Tesla Model 3 Valet key with acetone





Process took 1.5 hours to dissolves using glass container. Strange that it dissolved from the center.( I assume because of the Tesla logo).

Success!!! We have a chip!!
